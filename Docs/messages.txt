Looks good, I've not had time to write it up yet, but I think the stages that we need to go through are this. Do you see any issues with the below? Afraid this is straight out of my head.



Registration
- Companies register as either an Agent or a Source.



System Verification
- Sources: After registering, sources must pass an automated API test. They will enter a test Agreement ID, and the system will run a suite of simulated tests against their API to confirm everything responds correctly.
- Agents: Agents must also pass verification by creating, modifying, and cancelling a booking against test data we provide (instead of using live data). This ensures their integration works correctly before they can access real agreements.



Agreements
- A Source should be able to offer an agreement to an Agent.
- The Agent must then approve the agreement before it becomes active.
- This process should trigger both:
- An email notification to the Agent.
- A dashboard notification showing new agreements awaiting approval.



Locations
- Use NATO LOCODES as the base location list.
- Suppliers expose a locations endpoint listing supported locations (as in the previous backend).
- These locations must match NATO LOCODES.
- The system should:
- - Periodically check supported locations per Source.
- - Respect differences in location availability per agreement. When checking, the agreement reference must be included (as with the echo).



Availability Endpoint
- This is the first production-grade endpoint.
- While transport is via JSON and gRPC, the data model should follow the OTA XML API specification.
- Many partners already use OTA, which should make integration easier.



First Test Cycle
- Build a skeleton Agent website to test the Availability API.
- Internally, we will integrate the Availability API for at least two Sources.
- Deploy the system into a live environment to run:
- - Functional tests (agent–source integration).
- - Scaling tests (identify and address bottlenecks early).



Logging
- For all booking operations, log every request sent and every response received.
- This is essential for traceability and debugging.



Core Booking Endpoints
- Implement the remaining endpoints:
- - Create Booking
- - Cancel Booking
- - Modify Booking
- - Check Booking
- For these, the system acts as a pass-through layer: ingest data, append the agreement reference, and forward to the appropriate supplier.
- Unlike Availability, each booking request is sent to a single supplier only.



SDKs
- Provide lightweight SDKs in common languages (Node.js, PHP, Java, Python, Perl).
- These serve as both a framework and example implementations for Sources and Agents.

Apologies if you tried to read that straight away, copy and paste messed with the formatting, but I've fixed it now.

Sohaib Ahmad 7:28 PM
Hi sir

thanks for this now the plan is clear to me

so should we move step by step?

Richard LIttle 9:29 PM
Sorry, Rick is away at the moment, so agent and source are the 2 sides of the middle ware. Agent would be like booking.com, they are looking for cars to hire, source is like enterprise, they have cars to rent out. The agent therefore when they sign up just needs an account to start with. They can then speak to sources who can send them agreements to accept.

Hi sir
Hope you are doing well
i want to inform that i have created the most flows as explained above



i wanna ask that
This is the first production-grade endpoint.
- While transport is via JSON and gRPC, the data model should follow the OTA XML API specification.
- Many partners already use OTA, which should make integration easier.



can you explain this part a little more



also do we first need to deploy on server or should i start developing sdks after finishing

RL
Richard LIttle 1:36 PM
So attached the the OTA XML specification, we are only dealing with car hire, so we only really care about the OTA_Veh* requests and responses. To make it easier, rather than coming up with the field names that need to be sent, we should use the field names that the OTA uses, as this will make it easier for people to integrate with.

Thanks for your response sir
i got it i will complete this flow within 2 days and than start building php sdk

can you also clear about the locations a little bit? is it should be exactly like what we were doing before? like same respone format from them






Sorry for the delay, and thanks for your patience. I’ve taken some time to work through where we’re heading, and things have shifted a bit. I’d like us to take a step back and focus first on getting the Ping/Echo API endpoint working but doing so in a way that sets the right foundation for scale and performance.



I’ll expand the document later to cover locations, availability, and booking flows, but I believe it’s important that Echo is solid and scalable before we build on top of it. The performance and scalability aspects are key to the overall success of the project.



This document outlines the direction we’re aiming for and how we see it working. It may differ from where we are today, but it’s better to make these adjustments early than later. I expect there will be plenty of questions, and I’ll check in later to go through any queries you might have.



I don’t want to enforce a design pattern you’re not comfortable with we can adapt as needed but we do have clear scalability requirements that need to be met.

Thanks for sharing this direction—it makes sense to get the Ping/Echo API working first and ensure the foundation is strong before we layer on more features like locations, availability, and booking.



I agree that scalability and performance are critical, so I’ll focus on structuring the Echo implementation in a way that can handle growth (e.g., stateless design, clean separation of concerns, and room for distributed scaling if needed).



I’ll start outlining the approach and highlight any open questions or assumptions so we can align early. Once the Echo endpoint is solid, it’ll be easier and safer to extend into the rest of the flows.



Thanks sir

Hi sir



my initial questions are :



Do you have a preferred language/runtime for the middleware (Node.js, Go, Java), or should I pick?
What’s the maximum long-poll duration (wait_ms) you’d like me to allow (e.g. 10s, 15s)?
For the agreement_ref values, do you want me to generate them automatically, or will you provide them when setting up Agreements?
When a Source is too slow (over the 3s threshold), should we keep the default backoff/exclusion policy from the spec (1h → 2h → 4h), or do you want to adjust these timings?
Do you want us to mark timed-out Sources explicitly in the results (e.g., a count or list), or just finalize the response as COMPLETE without details?
For the Admin platform, should we build a basic dashboard in the PoC (to manage agreements & reset Source health), or is that part of a later phase?
For observability, do you have a preferred stack (CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry, Datadog), or should I just add structured logs and metrics for now?

I have understand the system we are gonna build and it is amazing and really scalable

RL
Richard LIttle
2:27 PM
Do you have a preferred language/runtime for the middleware (Node.js, Go, Java), or should I pick?
- Personally I prefer Node (because I know it), but feel free to pcik



What’s the maximum long-poll duration (wait_ms) you’d like me to allow (e.g. 10s, 15s)?
- I think we may have to adjust it once live, so lets start at 10s



For the agreement_ref values, do you want me to generate them automatically, or will you provide them when setting up Agreements?
- I think that the soruces will want to set these to match their internal systems, so we should have it in the admin area when they are setting them up. Maybe include a warning if its a duplicate within their agreements.



When a Source is too slow (over the 3s threshold), should we keep the default backoff/exclusion policy from the spec (1h → 2h → 4h), or do you want to adjust these timings?
- I think the backoff policy is right, but I equally think it should be on a strike basis before it kicks in, so maybe 3 strikes before it escalates. I also think maybe we should start lower at 15 mins, rather than straight to 1 hour)



Do you want us to mark timed-out Sources explicitly in the results (e.g., a count or list), or just finalize the response as COMPLETE without details?
- Just finalise the results as somplete



For the Admin platform, should we build a basic dashboard in the PoC (to manage agreements & reset Source health), or is that part of a later phase?
- I think you actually have more of this than you think in the dashboard that you started, so let's add it into there as you already have the registration stuff, and we will still have to do the locations in a similar way to you already have, no point in throwing out something that is working and boardly covers what we will need



For observability, do you have a preferred stack (CloudWatch, OpenTelemetry, Datadog), or should I just add structured logs and metrics for now?
- I think for now, let's just add structured logs, but make sure it's separated so we can easily swap out to a platform later, however it will probably be on an ELK stack eventually, as again, it's what I know. However I don't want to hold you up if your more comfortable with something else.

[Matt]: Are you happy with everything in that doc as a Milestone, or do you want to split it down further?

Sohaib Ahmad
12:13 AM
Hi Matt
I think it makes sense to split into two milestones:



Milestone 1: Core Echo flow – Submit/Poll with request IDs, agreements, long-polling (10s), 120s timeout, basic logging, and agreements in the admin dashboard.



Milestone 2: Source health and admin enhancements – strike-based slow source policy (15m backoff), health tracking with reset in admin, and structured logging ready for ELK later.

That way we lock the foundation first, then add the refinements.

RL
Richard LIttle
10:59 AM
Matthew will arrange, how long do you expect Milestone 1 and 2 to take

Sohaib Ahmad
12:09 PM
For timing, I’d expect:

Milestone 2 (Health + Admin enhancements): ~ 3–4 days



So in total around 1 week if we go back-to-back.

in video i'm showing



The middleware accepts a request (SubmitEcho) with an active agreement, assigns a unique request ID, and fans out to 3 simulated sources. Each source emits partial results, then either a final or an error. The client polls (GetEchoResults) until all sources complete, and the system marks the request finalized. Logs show each step with IDs, and Prometheus metrics confirm submits, polls, emitted items (partials/finals/errors), and request lifetime — proving the full submit → poll → finalize cycle is working with validation, logging, and observability

Hi this is Rick, how many days have you done since i last paid you

and how is the progress

Hi Sir,



The implementation is nearly complete. I’m currently preparing the documentation and testing guide for Mat to validate everything.



While it may not be 100% perfect yet, I’ve ensured that the current version fully aligns with the functional guide. We might need a few minor tweaks during testing, but the core system is stable and operational.



At this stage, it’s already utilizing gRPC internally for key processes such as polling, source health checks, and validation handling, ensuring efficient communication and reliability.
only working on minor tweaks in connections

Hi sir I'm sharing one version for testing locally if want but i will suggest that i should setup it on vps for testing



To run the backend first install the npm install in the main then in the ⁠ agent-backend ⁠ folder and also ⁠ source-backend ⁠ after that in the main run this: ⁠ npm run prisma:gen ⁠ -> ⁠ npm run prisma:migrate ⁠ -> ⁠ npm run prisma:seed ⁠ -> ⁠ npm run seed:unlocode ⁠ -> ⁠ npm run test:grpc ⁠ to run all server at once -> ⁠ npm run dev:all ⁠ | If token related issue comes in the agent Backend then register the agent and add its token into the .env file of the agent-backend



For the frontend -> Simply install -> npm package and ⁠ npm run dev ⁠ for each one.



updated.zip contain our core backend
agent.zip ann example agent and source is an example of source and admin contain frontend

thats not perfect version it contains grpc setup connection and agreement offering part
validation part



i'm working continously to improve and creating a php sdk for easily testing

But my true suggestions is setting up a test server because setting up local is little critical and also the mtls verification is commented for now because locally it does not work perfectly it can be working perfectly on linux part
